# Column (block) insert/delete on VIM

# Block insert

1. Move the cursor to the uppermost character (if you’re selecting lines the way down, bottom if you’re going up) before which you want to insert text
2. Enter Visual Block Mode by pressing Ctrl+v (unless you mapped the paste action to it, in which case you probably already know how to column insert)
3. Select the column using the arrow keys
4. Press Shift+i (switching into Insert Mode)
5. Type the text you want to insert (will be displayed only on the first line)
6. Press esc two times

# Block delete

In case you want to delete text, follow steps 1 through 3 and simply select all text you wish to delete, then press x and you’re done!
