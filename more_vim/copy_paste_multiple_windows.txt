# Copy and paste with multiple windows

It sounds like you're trying to paste text that already has indents included, and vim is auto-indenting and that's messing with the format.
  
# Run this before you paste
:set paste

That should disable the auto-indenting that's messing with the paste.  

# Then re-enable auto-indenting with
:set nopaste

You can also bind "pastetoggle" to a key so you can turn paste on and off with a keypress.
