# Insert a character of multiple lines where the line length varies

Q:
Is there a way in vim that I can block select and insert a character for multiple lines where the line length varies.

I will need to add a closing parenthesis before the comma in each test case.

Here is my toy example.

test_case = [
    (1: "yes",
    (2: "no",
    (3: "something else",
]

A:
Given that you have a pattern you can use, the best way to do it would be to select the block and then use substitution from there.

If you have those lines in a visual block, for example, then hit ":", then the range of that block will be inserted for you ('<,'>).
Leave that in place and you can use substitution to perform the the replacement for commas at the end of lines (assuming there aren't spaces after the commas):

:'<,'>s/,$/),/g
